# Word Connections
### `a Positive Affirmations creation`

## *Objective* 
# Our goal was to craete a websiite that meets the criteria of the following user story.

`AS A person who doesn’t know this word`
*I WANT to be able to easily search in one spot and find tons of cool stuff about the word*
*SO THAT I now know how to use the word*


### Method
We started by planning on a white board the layout of the website and what we wanted it to do<br>
We then decided on the tools we would use ( css framework/api's). Next our team created a kanban board and defined the tasks we had to work<br>
